  # warmUpExercise Example function in R
  #   A = warmUpExercise() is an example function that returns the 5x5 identity matrix
  
  
  # ============= YOUR CODE HERE ==============
  # Instructions: Return the 5x5 identity matrix 
  #               In R, we return values as the last variable defined. 
  
  
  A = diag(5);
  
  # it can be even as an explicit return
  # return(A)
  # but is unnecessary
